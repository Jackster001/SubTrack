# SubTrack

## Inspiration
People have loads of subscriptions and it's hard to keep track of them all. So we decided to make a tool to keep all of your subscriptions in one email inbox.

## What it does
SubTrack lets users add subscriptions they applied for and update and delete them as they wish. Users will also receive email notifications if they have registered for an account, added a new subscription, or if their bill is coming within less than a week. Never miss another subscription payment!

There are 3 main features and locales of our application:
1. **Login and Signup**, where you create your account and manage your account
2. **Email notifications**, where we periodically check for any soon to expire subscriptions, and notify you. This can be toggled in subscription management
3. **Subscription management**, where you can add, modify, remove, and see general data about your spending habits

- Changes to account management so you can correct names and emails
